 * Movim is an XMPP-based communication platform. It uses a widget-based UI
 * system. A widget is a combination of server-side and client-side scripts that
 * interact though a custom xmlrpc protocol.
 *
 * Movim's core is designed to ease the implementation of XMPP web-based clients,
 * using massively asynchronous javascript and abstracting XMPP calls into an
 * events-based API.
